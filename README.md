## üì¶ Dependencies and Required Packages
### Python:
Assuming that `Python` is installed in the targeted machine, we can create a virtual environment for the project by running the following command:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
To install the required packages, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### C++:
- A modern C++ compiler supporting the **C++17 standard**. Recent versions of `clang` and `g++` on Linux is known to work.
- The [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system. For install using `apt` (Ubuntu, Debian...):
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install cmake 
```
- The [Boost](https://www.boost.org) library. For install using `apt` (Ubuntu, Debian...):
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install libboost-dev
```
## üìã Build Instructions
First, clone the repository and change the current directory to the cloned repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/porya-gohary/ReDo.git
cd ReDo
```
To compile the framework for the input codes written in `ReDo DSL`, follow the instructions below:

Consider we want to compile the framework for the example code `example.redo` in the `examples` directory. The following commands should be executed:
```bash
./compile.sh -i ./example/example1.redo
```
The compiled code will be generated in the `build` directory. To run the compiled code, run the following command:
```bash
cd build
./redo
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
The options of the analysis are as follows (`./redo -h`):
```
Usage: redo [OPTIONS]...

Options:
  -l TIMEOUT, --time-limit=TIMEOUT
                        maximum CPU time allowed (in seconds, zero means no limit)
  -n, --naive           use the naive exploration method (default: false)
  -r, --raw             print output without formatting (default: false)
  -o OUTPUTFILE, --output=OUTPUTFILE
                        name of the output file (default: out.csv)
  -e VERBOSE, --verbose=VERBOSE
                        print log messages [0-5](default: 0)
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Output Files
The output files are generated in the current directory. The output files are as follows:

* `out.csv`: The output file containing the response-times for each job.
* `out.dot`: The output file containing the graph of the explored states.
